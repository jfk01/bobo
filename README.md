Overview
--------

The BUBO project is a set of matlab and python client tools for distributed stream processing of computer vision tasks.
These tools are designed to interface with a Spark cluster for performance analysis of large datasets.


Design Goals
------------

* BUBO is designed for researchers performing interactive analysis of large vision datasets
* BUBO is designed for stream processing of images and video 
* BUBO provides a tools for typical computer vision performance evaluations (classification, detection, ...)
* BUBO is designed for easy deployment of vision tasks on a spark production cluster
* BUBO is open source and written in python and C++, and designed for iPython interactive usage


Dependencies
------------
Required: numpy, opencv, matplotlib, sklearn
Optional: flickrapi, nltk, pygame
